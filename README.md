# INTAL
The maximum limit of Unsigned Long Int in C/C++ is 18446744073709551615, a 20 digit number. While languages like C++/Java support classes of BigIntegers (100 digit numbers). C by default has no such support. This project aims to bring that support to the C language along with basic arithmetic operations like Comparison, Addition, Subtraction and Multiplication along with applications such as Factorial, Fibonacci etc.  

## High-Level Approach
- Write a function to declare and initialize INTALs.    
- Write a function to compare INTALs; returns equal, lesser than or greater than comparisons of inputted numbers.  
- Implement basic arithmetic operations on INTAL : Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication.  
- Implement applications of INTAL: Fibonacci number, Factorial.  

## Applications  
- Calculate factorial of very large integers.  
- Calculate very large nth Fibonacci number.  
- Calculate binomial coefficient of very large numbers.  
- Perform binary exponentiation on very large numbers or raise numbers to very large powers.   
- Greatest Common Divisor.
